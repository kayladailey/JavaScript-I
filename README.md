## Assignment Description
* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
* Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
* To test your `console.log()` statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  


### Objects

To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The [objects.js](assignments/objects.js) file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills answer vital questions for HR.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges
* Don't work on stretch until you have completed all assignments

### Arrays

The [arrays.js](assignments/arrays.js) assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars.  You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory.  Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.

* Utilize the the array `inventory` to complete your challenges
* Use any array method you see fit to solve the problem
* Don't work on stretch until you have completed all assignments

### Arrow Function Syntax

* [ ] Arrow Function Syntax - [Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26). You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the [function-conversion.js](assignments/function-conversion.js) file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.  

### Stretch

* Move on to tomorrow's content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
* Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.
